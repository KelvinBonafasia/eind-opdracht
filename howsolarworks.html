        </header>
        <footer>
            <p>The term solar panel is used colloquially for a photo-voltaic (PV) module.
                A PV module is an assembly of photo-voltaic cells mounted in a framework for installation. Photo-voltaic
                cells use sunlight as a source of energy and generate direct current electricity. A collection of PV
                modules is called a PV Panel, and a system of Panels is an Array. Arrays of a photovoltaic system supply
                solar electricity to electrical equipment.
                The most common application of solar energy collection outside agriculture is solar water heating
                systems.

            <p>A charge controller, charge regulator or battery regulator limits the rate at which electric current is
                added to or drawn from electric batteries. It prevents overcharging and may protect against overvoltage,
                which can reduce battery performance or lifespan and may pose a safety risk. It may also prevent
                completely
                draining ("deep discharging") a battery, or perform controlled discharges, depending on the battery
                technology,
                to protect battery life. The terms "charge controller" or "charge regulator" may refer to either a
                stand-alone
                device, or to control circuitry integrated within a battery pack, battery-powered device, or battery
                charger.

        <footer>
            <p>A battery management system (BMS) is any electronic system that manages a rechargeable battery
                (cell or battery pack), such as by protecting the battery from operating outside its safe operating
                area,
                monitoring its state, calculating secondary data, reporting that data, controlling its environment,
                authenticating it and / or balancing it.
                A battery pack built together with a battery management system with an external communication data bus
                is
                a smart battery pack. A smart battery pack must be charged by a smart battery charger.

            <h1>DC power</h1>
        </header>
        <footer>
            <p>Direct current (DC) is the one directional or unidirectional flow of electric charge. An electrochemical
                cell is a prime example of DC power. Direct current may flow through a conductor such as a wire,
                but can also flow through semiconductors, insulators, or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion
                beams.
                The electric current flows in a constant direction, distinguishing it from alternating current (AC).
                A term formerly used for this type of current was galvanic current.

        </header>
        <footer>
            <p>
                A power inverter, or inverter, is a power electronic device or circuitry that changes direct current
                (DC) to alternating current (AC).
                The input voltage, output voltage and frequency, and overall power handling depend on the design of the
                specific device or circuitry. The inverter does not produce any power; the power is provided by the DC
                source.
                A power inverter can be entirely electronic or may be a combination of mechanical effects (such as a
                rotary apparatus) and electronic circuitry. Static inverters do not use moving parts in the conversion
                process.

            <h1>AC power</h1>
        </header>
        <footer>
            <p>
                Instantaneous power in an electric circuit is the rate of flow of energy past a given point of the
                circuit. In alternating current circuits, energy storage elements such as inductors and capacitors may
                result in periodic reversals of the direction of energy flow.
                The portion of power that, averaged over a complete cycle of the AC waveform, results in net transfer of
                energy in one direction is known as active power (more commonly called real power to avoid ambiguity
                especially in discussions of loads with non-sinusoidal currents).
